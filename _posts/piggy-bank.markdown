# Piggy Bank

## Introduction
Since graduating a few weeks ago I have been working on a project that I pitched
at the Iron Yard for final projects.  I got such a positive response after pitching
the idea that I decided to pursue it after graduating.

**Piggy bank** is an interactive accounting app for children (ages 5-9).  It incorporates
fully functioning mock banking capabilities with a gameshow-like UI with all the bells
and whistles to keep your child entertained.  

What makes this educational tool special is the 'how many' feature that teaches
children the value of items in their every day lives.  If your' daughter wants to purchase
a new Tea Set made from Waterford Crystal, she can enter the price of the tea set into our app
and it will generate comparisons for her.  That tea set will cost the same as 200
Barbie dolls, dinner for 10 at Per Se, the cost of a car, etc...
